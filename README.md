## Implementing the Backseat Driver Architecture on a G3S Slocum Glider: A Manual for Operators

This manual is a starting point for anyone who wants to implement the Slocum backseat driver architecture on a G3S Slocum glider. 

It also may be regarded as everything required to replicate, follow along, and/or continue with my thesis work as this manual is complementary to my Master's thesis \textit{Sensor and Behavior Frameworks for Implementing Backseat Driver on a Slocum Glider}.

### **Number prefixes refer to chapter numbers**
The numbers at the start of each folder refers to chapter's in *Implementing the Backseat Driver Architecture on a G3s Slocum Glider: A Manual for Operators*, located in the main folder. 

### How to Use This Manual

This manual has been written so one can work sequentially through this document and the concepts within as they progressively get more advanced. If you feel you already know something, please feel free to use the Contents page to skip to the area you want to know more about! 

1. **Chapters 1-2:** Background about what the backseat driver architecture is, what an external controller is, how it is used and the type used in this manual, then how to implement the external controller onboard a glider or a glider simulator. 
2. **Chapters 3-6:** Learning glider piloting and simulation, then performing a simple backseat driver mission.
3. **Chapter 7:** A more advanced backseat driver application
4. **Chapters 8-9:** Reading and manipulating science data onboard the external controller. Sending a file processed on the external controller to the glider, for ability to retrieve via SFMC mid-mission.
